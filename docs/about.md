## Who I Am

Hi, I'm **Jeremy LE CLEC'H** — a Network Consulting Engineer at Cisco, passionate about network automation, Service Provider technologies, and building solutions that make complex networks manageable.

I specialize in transforming manual network operations into automated, scalable systems. My journey took me from a pre-sales engineer with zero coding experience to building CI/CD pipelines and orchestration platforms for Service Provider networks.

## My Philosophy

**Start Before You're Ready**
My first automation project was built in one week with almost zero Python experience. The best time to start is now, not after you've mastered every concept.

**Each Experience Builds on the Last**
From VBA scripts automating Word documents to CI/CD pipelines deploying configurations across Service Provider networks — every skill compounds.

**Automation Is a Mindset, Not a Tool**
The specific technology matters less than asking: *"Can this be automated?"*
