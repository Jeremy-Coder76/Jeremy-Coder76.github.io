Technical mastery comes through successive real-world experiences, each building on the last. Timeline at a Glance Period Role Company Key Learning 2013-2018 Engineering Student ESIGELEC IT & Networks Foundation 2015-2018 Pre-Sales Engineer Orange Business Services Customer needs, VBA automation Jun-Sep 2017 Virtualization Engineer Orange Polska ONAP, Python, Netconf 2018-2020 Network & Security Engineer Nomios Multi-vendor security, First real automation Mar-Sep 2020 Graduate Program (CCNA/CCNP + TAC) Cisco (Poland) Technical foundation & customer support Sep 2020-Present Network Consulting Engineer Cisco (France) Service Provider automation at scale Feb 2022-Mar 2023 Guest Lecturer ESIGELEC Teaching network security Chapter 1: The Sales Engineer Who Automated (2015-2018) Orange Business Services: Where It All Began While studying at ESIGELEC engineering school, I started an apprenticeship at Orange Business Services as a Pre-Sales Engineer in 2015. My job was to: - Respond to customer RFPs (Request for Proposals) - Design custom network architectures - Create commercial proposals - Accompany sales teams to client meetings The Problem: I spent hours manually creating similar network proposals in Word, copying and pasting, adjusting formatting, updating tables... The Solution: I taught myself VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) to automate document generation. Not glamorous, but it was my first taste of automation's power. The Realization: \"Why am I doing this manually?\" became my mantra. Orange Polska: The ONAP Mission (Summer 2017) During my studies, I did a 4-month mission at Orange Polska in Warsaw as a Virtualization Engineer. This was transformative: Project: Analyze and implement ONAP (Open Network Automation Platform) Skills Developed: - Python scripting - Bash automation - Netconf protocol - Yang models and JSON formats Key Insight: I saw that automation would be implemented in the future, and that I would like to be part of it. Graduation & Decision (2018) After graduating from ESIGELEC with an Engineering degree of business in IT and Network, I had a choice: - Stay in pre-sales (comfortable, good pay) - Move to build & run (hands-on, technical) The Career-Defining Decision I chose the technical path. This decision to move from comfortable pre-sales to hands-on technical work was the foundation for everything that followed. Chapter 2: Into the Network Trenches (2018-2020) Nomios: Multi-Vendor Security Reality Joining Nomios as a Network & Security Engineer in September 2018 was a major challenge. This was my first hands-on job, working directly in front of customers on a daily basis while learning security technologies. During my time at Nomios, I worked with over 30 different customers. Technologies I Managed: - Firewalls: Palo Alto (PCNSE certified), Fortinet - Proxy: Zscaler - Other: Riverbed Steel Connect, Cisco ASA/Firepower - Cloud: Azure (Associate Administrator 103), AWS The Challenge: Each vendor had different: - CLIs - APIs - Configuration paradigms - Management interfaces The Turning Point This is where automation became essential, not optional. Managing 30+ customers with different vendors made manual configuration unsustainable. My First Real Automation Project When I arrived at Nomios in 2018, REST APIs on network devices were just becoming mainstream, but almost nobody was using them. This would be my first network automation project on production devices for a customer - unlike ONAP at Orange Polska, which was still theoretical and in R&D, not yet in production. I discovered Postman - a fantastic graphical tool to explore APIs without coding. Pro Tip for Beginners If you're starting with APIs, Postman is your best friend. It lets you explore APIs graphically without writing code first! The Duplicate Objects Problem The Challenge: Our firewalls had hundreds of duplicate objects with the same IP addresses but different names: Example: Server_A: - ip_address: 10.10.0.1 Server_B: - ip_address: 10.10.0.1 Server_C: - ip_address: 10.10.0.2 The Risk: - Before deleting Server_A, I needed to find everywhere it was used (security rules, NAT rules, security profiles, etc.) - Replace Server_A with Server_B in all dependencies - Only then safely delete Server_A Manual Process: Hours per firewall, error-prone, mind-numbing. The Automation Solution Step 1: Learn the API with Postman - Authenticate to the firewall API - GET all objects - Replace an object in its dependencies - DELETE an object Step 2: Build a Python Script With a colleague, we built our first Python automation script in one week with almost zero prior Python or REST API knowledge (though we knew C and Java from school). The script: 1. Retrieves all duplicate objects 2. Lets you choose which object to keep 3. Replaces all references to duplicates with the keeper 4. Verifies the object to delete has no dependencies 5. Deletes the duplicate object Result: What took hours manually now took minutes. We were hooked. Key Lesson: Start Before You're Ready You don't need to be an expert to start. We built a production-ready script in one week as complete beginners with zero Python experience. The best time to start automating is NOW. Chapter 3: The Cisco Era - Automation at Scale (2020-Present) Cisco Graduate Program: Foundation Building (Mar-Sep 2020) In March 2020, I joined Cisco's EMEAR Graduate Program in Cracow, Poland - an intensive 6-month training program that happens twice a year (March and September). First 3 Months: Technical & Soft Skills Training - Networking fundamentals: CCNA and CCNP certifications - Soft skills development: stress management, customer communication, presentation skills - Building a strong technical foundation Last 3 Months: TAC (Technical Assistance Center) - Hands-on experience in Cisco's Technical Access Support - Real-world troubleshooting and customer support - Learning to handle complex technical issues under pressure This program transformed me from an engineer into a consultant, teaching me not just technical skills but how to effectively communicate and deliver value to customers. Then came the move to France... Cisco France: Technical Leadership & Service Provider Automation (Sep 2020-Present) Since September 2020, I've been a Network Consulting Engineer in France, where I joined the Consulting Service Provider teams . This is where everything came together. My Role: - Drive network automation for Service Provider customers - Design and implement automation solutions for large-scale networks - Build web applications and orchestration tools for network deployment Technologies I Specialize In Today Service Provider Networks: Working mainly on Backbone and Edge networks with: - Cisco IOS-XR - Nokia SROS - Huawei Datacenter (less frequent, but still present): - Fabric IP VXLAN (NX-OS + ACI) for datacenter environments Automation & Development Stack: The most important focus today is the creation of web applications and NSO services to deploy infrastructure and services across Service Provider networks. Languages: Python Web Frameworks: Django, FastAPI (for building automation web applications) Network Orchestration: Cisco NSO (for service deployment across SP networks) CI/CD: GitLab pipelines for automated testing and deployment Configuration Management: Ansible AI-Assisted Development: GitHub Copilot (since 2024) Why This Matters: Service Provider networks operate at massive scale. My work focuses on building complete automation solutions - from web interfaces that operators use, to NSO services that orchestrate configuration across thousands of devices. This requires combining software development skills (Django/FastAPI) with deep networking knowledge (IOS-XR, SROS, Huawei) and orchestration expertise (NSO). The Evolution: From Scripts to Systems The 5-Year Automation Evolution My automation journey evolved step by step: 2018: Single-purpose Python scripts (firewall cleanup) 2019-2020: Reusable functions and modules 2021-2022: Ansible playbooks for multi-device orchestration 2023: CI/CD pipelines with automated testing, NSO for service orchestration 2024-Present: Full-stack automation solutions - Django/FastAPI web applications integrated with NSO for complete SP network automation. GitHub Copilot accelerating development. Each layer built on the previous one. You don't jump from scripts to CI/CD overnight - it's a gradual progression. Full Circle: Teaching the Next Generation (2022-2023) From February 2022 to March 2023, I returned to ESIGELEC as a Guest Lecturer , teaching a 20-hour module on network security (CERT certification track). What I Taught: - Network security fundamentals - Modern automation approaches - How to think about security in automated environments What I Learned: - Teaching forces you to truly understand your subject - The next generation is hungry for automation knowledge - My journey from student to teacher completed a circle Key Takeaways 10 Years of Learning - What Really Matters After 10 years in the industry, here's what I've learned: 1. You Don't Need Permission to Start I wasn't hired to automate at Orange. I just started because it solved my problem (VBA for proposals). That curiosity led everywhere else. 2. Each Experience Builds on the Last Sales taught me to understand customer needs Networking gave me hands-on technical depth Automation combined both: technical solutions to business problems This journey couldn't be skipped. Each step was necessary. 3. Start Small, Think Big My first automation was VBA in Word. My latest is CI/CD pipelines for Service Provider networks. Both started with: \"This is tedious, there must be a better way.\" 4. Learn in Public, Share the Journey Whether it's teaching at ESIGELEC, writing this blog, or helping clients, sharing knowledge accelerates everyone's growth. 5. The Tools Change, The Mindset Doesn't I've used VBA, Postman, Python, Ansible, NSO, Docker... The specific tool matters less than asking: \"Can this be automated?\" What's Next? This blog will dive deeper into: - From Pre-Sales to Automation Expert - How sales experience made me a better automator - Network Automation Journey - From scripts to CI/CD pipelines - Service Provider Transformation - Automation at carrier scale Stay tuned for detailed posts on each chapter of this journey.
